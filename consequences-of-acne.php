			<h1>Understanding the consequences<br />of acne and acne scarring</h1>
			<hr />
			
			<p class="subhead">Severe acne can cause permanent scarring. This scarring can have major
lifelong consequences that affect peopleâ€™s social lives, self-esteem,
and even their ability to get a job.</p>

				<h3>The physical damage of acne</h3>
				<p>Acne causes injury to the skin.  Although any type of acne can lead to permanent skin damage, it is difficult to predict which people may develop acne scarring. As with most injuries, the quicker you treat it, the better off you are.</p>

				<h3>Not all acne scars look the same.</h3>			
				<p>Depending on how they look, health care providers often categorize scars as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ice pick</li>
					<li>Rolling</li>
					<li>Boxcar</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sixty percent to 70% of acne scars are considered ice pick scars.</p>

				<p style="margin-top: 0;">Although any type of acne can lead to scars, cysts and nodules have the greatest potential to damage the skin. Acne scars, whether because of an excess or a loss of skin tissue, may stand out permanently. Without timely, appropriate treatment,
scarring may affect up to 95% of people with acne. </p>

				<p style="margin-top: 0;">The physical damage that acne and acne scarring cause can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression. Embarrassment about acne can cause social withdrawal. Not surprisingly, acne that leads to scarring has been shown to have a negative impact on social lives and relationships.</p>
				<p>Studies have shown that teenagers with acne feel more isolated and self-conscious than teenagers who are free from acne. Scars that develop from acne are often a devastating consequence of waiting for proper medical treatment.</p>
