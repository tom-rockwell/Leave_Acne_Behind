				<h3>Hormones play a role</h3>
				<p>During the early teenage years, the body begins to make more hormones. Some of these hormones, called androgens, cause oil glands in the skin to get bigger and make more oil, or sebum.</p>

				<h3>Bacterial buildup</h3>
				<p>When pores become blocked with a combination of too much sebum and dead skin cells, bacteria start to build up. This causes the redness, swelling, and infection that we associate with acne lesions, which can range from mild to severe and cause scarring.</p>

				<p>Acne is a continuous process and causes the eruption of new lesions over time. Acne is usually classified (mild, moderate, or severe) by the primary lesions present and the severity of those lesions.</p>

				<h3>Noninflammatory acne</h3>			
				<p>Noninflammatory acne consists of comedones.
When pores are closed, these comedones are
called whiteheads. Whiteheads stay below the
surface of the skin, and the tops of the plugs
are white. Open comedones are called
blackheads.</p>
				<p>Blackheads:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Occur when the pores open to the surface and the sebum inside turns brown or black</li>
					<li>Are not dirt and canâ€™t be washed away</li>
					<li>Can last a long time</li>

				<h3>Inflammatory acne</h3>
				<p>A blackhead or whitehead can release its contents and heal, or it can rupture and cause inflammatory acne. Inflammatory acne causes the skin to look red and swollen. Ruptures can happen on their own or as a result of picking or touching the skin, which is why skin with acne should be left untouched. Inflammatory acne lesions are are much more serious forms of acne and may be defined as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Papules</li>
					<li>Pustules</li>
					<li>Cysts</li>
					<li>Nodules</li>

				<h3>Severe nodular acne</h3>
				<p>People with severe nodular acne, the type that may damage skin, usually have intense erythema (abnormal redness), inflammation, nodules (lumps), cysts (growths filled with fluid), and scars.</p>
				<p>In more serious cases of acne, cysts and nodules may burst and damage nearby skin. There are many different treatments for acne, and your dermatology health care provider can help you decide which is best for you.</p>
